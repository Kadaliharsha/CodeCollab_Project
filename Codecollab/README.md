# CodeCollab

Welcome to **CodeCollab** ‚Äî a collaborative coding platform designed for real-time problem solving, code sharing, and peer learning. CodeCollab enables users to join virtual rooms, tackle coding challenges together, and see live code updates and results, making it ideal for interviews, hackathons, classrooms, and peer programming.

## üöÄ What is CodeCollab?

CodeCollab is an interactive web application that empowers multiple users to collaborate on coding problems in real time. Each room features a shared code editor, live output panel, and problem descriptions, allowing participants to write, execute, and submit code together. Submissions are automatically judged against test cases for instant feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** (Flask, SQLAlchemy): Backend API, room management, user authentication, and code execution logic.
- **HTML & Tailwind CSS**: Modern, responsive UI for the code editor and rooms.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication between clients for instant code updates and room events.
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent database for users, rooms, problems, and test cases.
- **Docker** (suggested): Isolated code execution environment (extensible for interview safety).
- **JavaScript**: Frontend interactivity and WebSocket event handling.
- **Session Recording**: Automatic event logging with JSON payloads and timestamps.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Core Features

- **Live Collaboration:** Join rooms, edit code together, and see real-time changes.
- **Problem Panel:** Every room displays a coding challenge with description and starter code.
- **Code Execution & Auto-Judging:** Instantly run code or submit it for automated test case evaluation.
- **User Authentication:** Register and log in (JWT-ready).
- **Database Seeding:** Preloaded with classic coding problems (e.g., Reverse String, Two Sum).
- **Scalable Design:** Easily add new problems and extend judging logic.
- **Session Recording:** Automatic logging of all room activities for replay and analytics.

## üìù Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kadaliharsha/CodeCollab.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   - Python libraries: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-SocketIO, etc.
   - Frontend: Tailwind via CDN, Socket.IO JS.
3. **Configure environment:**  
   Edit `config.py` for database connection details.
4. **Seed the database:**  
   ```bash
   python seed.py
   ```
5. **Run the app:**  
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
6. **Open in browser:**  
   Visit `http://localhost:5001/room/<room_id>` to join a room.

## üß≠ Session Recording & Analytics

CodeCollab now automatically records all room activities for replay, analytics, and debugging.

### What Gets Recorded
- **Room Events:** Creation, user joins/leaves
- **Code Activities:** Changes, language switches, runs, submissions  
- **Problem Events:** Loading problems, template resets
- **Timestamps:** Precise server-side timing for all events

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/sessions/<room_id>/timeline` - Get chronological event history
- `GET /api/sessions/<room_id>/summary` - Get event counts and session stats

### Example Usage
```bash
# Get full timeline for a room
curl http://localhost:5001/api/sessions/abc123/timeline

# Get session summary
curl http://localhost:5001/api/sessions/abc123/summary
```

### Database Schema
Events are stored in the `SessionEvent` table:
- `room_id` - Which room the event occurred in
- `event_type` - Type of action (join, code_change, submit, etc.)
- `payload` - JSON data specific to the event
- `created_at` - Server timestamp

### Use Cases
- **Replay Sessions:** Reconstruct exactly what happened in a room
- **Analytics:** Track user engagement, problem difficulty, collaboration patterns
- **Debugging:** Investigate issues by replaying the exact sequence of events
- **Auditing:** Maintain records of all coding activities

## üìö Example Problems

- Reverse a String
- Two Sum
- Easily add more in `seed.py`!

---

## üì¶ Folder Structure

- `app/` ‚Äî Main application code: models, API routes, templates.
- `run.py` ‚Äî App entry point.
- `seed.py` ‚Äî Database seeder.
- `config.py` ‚Äî Configuration settings.
