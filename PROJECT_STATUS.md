## 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**

### Typing Indicators
- Backend presence system ready
- Need to add frontend typing status display
- WebSocket events already implemented

## 📋 **NEXT PRIORITIES**

1. **Typing Indicators** - Show when users are typing
2. **Session Replay UI** - Timeline playback interface
3. **Analytics Dashboard** - User engagement metrics
4. **Enhanced Room UI** - Better user experience

## 🐛 **RECENT FIXES**

### Authentication Issues (RESOLVED)
- **Problem:** Username showing as "User" instead of actual login name
- **Root Cause:** Naming conflict between React state setter (`setUsername`) and auth utility function (`setUsername`)
- **Solution:** Renamed React state setter to `setUsernameState`
- **Result:** Username now displays correctly after login

### Database Issues (RESOLVED)
- **Problem:** UserPresence model constraint violations
- **Solution:** Made `user_id` nullable and fixed typos in model
- **Result:** User presence system working properly

## 📁 **KEY FILES**

### Backend
- `Codecollab/app/api_routes.py` - Main API and WebSocket routes
- `Codecollab/app/models.py` - Database models (User, Room, SessionEvent, UserPresence)
- `Codecollab/app/code_executor.py` - Docker code execution
- `Codecollab/run.py` - Flask app entry point

### Frontend
- `codecollab-frontend/src/pages/AuthPage.jsx` - Login/register page
- `codecollab-frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx` - Main dashboard
- `codecollab-frontend/src/pages/RoomPage.jsx` - Collaborative coding room
- `codecollab-frontend/src/utils/auth.js` - Authentication utilities
- `codecollab-frontend/src/App.jsx` - Main app with routing

## 🚀 **FOR NEW CHAT SESSION**

When starting a new chat, provide this context:

> "I'm working on CodeCollab, a real-time collaborative coding platform. The authentication system is fully working, users can create/join rooms, and real-time collaboration is active. The main remaining task is implementing typing indicators for the presence system. Here's the current status: [paste this file content]"
